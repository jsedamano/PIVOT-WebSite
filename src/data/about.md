# About PIVOT

PIVOT (Physics Infused Vision for Onward Thinking) is a student-led organization at Virginia Tech dedicated to applying physics-based thinking to real-world interdisciplinary challenges.

Our team is already composed of members from over 9 different majors across engineering, science, and the humanities. We’re united by a passion for creating innovative, impactful solutions by blending fundamental science with modern tools and creativity. We believe that physics isn't just confined to the lab — it’s a lens through which we can understand, model, and improve the world.

# Our Mission

To empower students from diverse academic backgrounds to develop and implement projects that use physics-based reasoning to tackle practical problems in society, technology, and the environment.

# Current Projects

We’re currently working on:

- A low-cost smart weather station optimized for campus microclimates
- A real-time pedestrian flow model to improve campus navigation and safety
- Exploratory work on physics-inspired generative art

Stay tuned for detailed write-ups and updates on these initiatives!

# Fun Fact

Our name, **PIVOT**, is both an acronym and a philosophy — sometimes, all it takes is a small shift in perspective to uncover something powerful.
